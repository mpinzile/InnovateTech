# InnovateTech Coding Challenges

Welcome to the InnovateTech Coding Challenges repository! This repository contains various coding challenges to help you improve your problem-solving and programming skills. Each challenge is designed to cover different aspects of programming and may include algorithms, data structures, string manipulation, mathematical problems, and more.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone` or download it as a ZIP file.
2. Navigate to the `Coding-Challenges` directory, where you will find subdirectories for each challenge.
3. Inside each challenge directory, you'll find the following files:
   - `README.md`: A description of the challenge, including the task, test cases, and instructions on how to run the code.
   - `solution.py` (or equivalent for other languages): A template file where you can implement your solution to the challenge.
   - `test_solution.py` (optional): A file containing test cases for the challenge. Use this to validate your solution.
   - Additional files (if needed): Some challenges may have additional input files or other resources.
4. Choose a challenge and read its README.md file to understand the task and requirements.
5. Implement your solution in the `solution.py` file or create a new file if necessary.
6. If available, run the test cases in `test_solution.py` to check if your solution passes all the tests.
7. Repeat steps 4-6 for other challenges to practice and improve your coding skills.
