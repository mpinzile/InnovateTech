# Challenge 03: Palindrome Check

## Description

Welcome to Challenge 03! In this coding challenge, you are tasked with writing a function that takes a string as input and returns `True` if the string is a palindrome, and `False` otherwise. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.

## Task

Write a function called `is_palindrome(input_string)` that takes a string `input_string` as input and returns `True` if it is a palindrome, and `False` otherwise.

## Test Cases

Test Case 1:
- Input: `"racecar"`
- Output: `True`

Test Case 2:
- Input: `"hello"`
- Output: `False`

Test Case 3:
- Input: `"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"`
- Output: `True`

## How to Run the Code

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the challenge folder.
2. Implement the `is_palindrome()` method using your favourite programming language.
3. Run the test cases using the example usage provided in the `solution.py` file or any other way suitable for your programming language.
4. Verify that your function passes all the test cases.
