# Challenge 05: Anagram Checker

## Overview

Welcome to Challenge 05! In this coding challenge, your task is to create a function or algorithm that can determine whether two input strings are anagrams of each other. Anagrams are words or phrases formed by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once.

## Task

Your task is to write a function or algorithm that takes two strings as input and determines whether they are anagrams of each other.

## Example

Consider the following examples:

1. Input: `"listen"`, `"silent"`
   Output: `True`

2. Input: `"hello"`, `"world"`
   Output: `False`

3. Input: `"debit card"`, `"bad credit"`
   Output: `True`

## Guidelines

1. Your solution should consider letter case (e.g., `"Listen"` and `"silent"` are not anagrams).
2. Your solution should consider spaces (e.g., `"debit card"` and `"bad credit"` are anagrams).
3. You can assume that the input strings only contain letters (no special characters or digits).

## How to Participate

1. Fork this repository (if applicable).
2. Implement your solution to the challenge in your preferred programming language.
3. Update the provided `are_anagrams` function or write your own implementation.
4. Test your solution with the provided test cases and additional cases if desired.
5. Submit your solution by creating a pull request or uploading your code to your repository.

## Submission

Please submit your solution in the form of code files (e.g., `.py`, `.java`, `.cpp`) and any supporting files. Feel free to include a brief explanation of your approach if necessary.

## Have Fun!

Enjoy the challenge and happy coding! If you have any questions, feel free to reach out.
