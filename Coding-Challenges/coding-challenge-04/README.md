# Challenge 04: Word Frequency Counter

## Description

Welcome to Challenge 04! In this coding challenge, you are tasked with writing a function or algorithm that takes a list of words as input and returns a data structure (such as a dictionary, hash map, or JavaScript Object literal) containing the frequency of each word in the list. The function should ignore the case of the words, treating uppercase and lowercase versions as the same word. Also, strip any leading or trailing spaces from each word before counting.

## Task

Write a function or algorithm called `word_frequency_counter(words_list)` that takes a list of words `words_list` as input and returns a data structure (e.g., dictionary, hash map, JavaScript Object literal) containing the frequency of each word in the list.

## Test Case

Test Case:
- Input: ["apple", "banana", "Apple", "orange", "banana", "apple"]
- Output: {'apple': 3, 'banana': 2, 'orange': 1}

## How to Run the Code

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the challenge folder.
2. Implement the `word_frequency_counter()` method using your favorite programming language.
3. Run the test case using the example usage provided.
4. Verify that your function provides the correct word frequency count as shown in the output.

Feel free to explore different approaches to solving the challenge. Remember to make your implementation case-insensitive and handle different forms of the same word as one (e.g., "apple" and "Apple" are considered the same). Also, ensure that you strip any leading or trailing spaces from each word before counting.

Good luck and happy coding!
